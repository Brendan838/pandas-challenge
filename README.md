# PyCitySchools Analysis

## Overview

This project, **PyCitySchools**, is an assignment for the U of MN data science bootcamp that involved completing data tasks within a Jupyter Notebook. Using Python and the Pandas library, I performed data analysis on school and standardized test data to identify trends in school performance across a cityâ€™s school district. 

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook in `PyCitySchools` is the primary script used for analysis, featuring data manipulation and table views to gain insights. This file was provided to me via the bootcamp and contained starter code. 
- **Data Files**: Relevant data files were provided (created using Mockaroo), enabling the analysis and generation of trend observations. Find these in the `Resources` folder.
